# WindowsServices
## About
Shitty code (mostly PoCs) usable in Windows services abuses.

## Why?
Because most of examples regarding windows services abuse i found, uses one of two tools to generate payloads:

- msfvenom
- powerup

The problem is that the payloads are flagged and come "pre cooked".  I needed more custom examples for courses and real life use cases.
